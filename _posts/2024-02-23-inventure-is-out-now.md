Today, we're very excited to release a prototype of the game we've been working on in our spare time over the past few months.

Inventure is an action puzzler in which you play an adventurer's Mum. 

While she's galavanting along, fighting monsters and collecting loot, you have to keep her bag tidy, and give her the items she needs to stay alive.

If you've ever wished for the further Tetris-ification of Deus Ex-style inventory systems, then this is the game for you. It's very hectic, but you can also get into a nice flow state, and it will satisfy that little voice in your head telling you to put things next to each other neatly.

The game started as our entry to the 2023 GMTK Game Jam, in which the theme was "Roles Reversed". The 48 hour window proved to be too short, however, to both learn Godot and make a game, so we carried on with it and here we are.

Inventure, as it is released today, is a fully functional prototype version of the game, which lets you play around with the mechanics and get a taste for what the full game would be like. If people like it, we'll try to flesh it out into a full release, with more variety, improved progresssion, narrative, and other exciting things like that.

Because it's a prototype, we've put it up for free right now. So download and enjoy! If you do choose to donate, then you'll get any updates if they do come, although we can make no guarantees that will happen, so better to think of it as a tip than a pre-order.

Go and give it a play, and let us know what you think!
