If you've not been around these parts before, you might have some questions.
So I'll try my best to pre-empt some of them.

## What do you do?
We make films and games with a homemade feel.
Our aim is to make people smile with our strange creations.
We love stop motion animation and games that are fun to poke - perhaps one day we'll combine the two.

## Who are you?
Alackaday productions a front for Lancashire-born and Manchester-based filmmaker/game developer Eddie Dearden to create nonsense.
He's got a PhD in computer science and yet he spent many days this year sculpting plastercine todgers.

Somebody should really stop him.

## What the heck's an alackaday?
Alackaday is an [archaic interjection](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alackaday) which expresses a feeling of "sorrow or deprecation"...

...which makes it the perfect word to sum up the process of making stop motion animations and videogames.

## Still not satisfied?
