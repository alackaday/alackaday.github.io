We make short films with a homemade quality.
That's a nice way of saying we glue things together and do stop motion with them.
Sometimes we've even been known to glue things together and shoot them in live action!

If you want to collaborate on a project, don't hesitate to [get in touch](/contact).
We're down to give pretty much anything a go, be it music videos, adverts, or dumb shorts.

Here's a selection of our films.

## Don't show your willy to the postman

We made a stop motion music video for [Owen Evans](https://soundcloud.com/owen-evans/tracks)' absolute banger, "Don't show your willy to the post man" ([which you should immediately add to all your Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/track/4XvpGMmodpL78zsPEGdngt?si=f31e28324e2a41da)).

## Samoa Joe's Bookclub

A silly short which answers one of life's great questions, "what if former WWE star Samoa Joe had a book club?"

## La Petit Homme

A short featuring a miniature version of myself.
Entirely shot with my phone, would you believe.
