We make short films with a homemade quality.
That's a nice way of saying we glue things together and do stop motion with them.
Sometimes we've even been known to glue things together and shoot them in live action!

If you want to collaborate on a project, don't hesitate to [get in touch](/contact).
We're down to give pretty much anything a go, be it music videos, adverts, or dumb shorts.

Here's a selection of our films.

## The Saloon Pianist

A stop motion animated short about a saloon pianist in the wild west who dreams of playing classical music.

## Don't show your willy to the postman

## Samoa Joe's Bookclub
