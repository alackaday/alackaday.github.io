We make games too!

Freshly baked, artisanal games. Straight out of the oven.

## Inventure

Inventure is an action puzzler in which you play an adventurer's Mum.
Organise your daughter's inventory and give her the items she needs to stay alive on her dangerous quest.

We've released a fully playable prototype of Inventure over on Itch.io, which you can download for free.
Give it a play, and let us know if you enjoy it.
If people like it, we'll try and make it into a full game, with a load more stuff in it!

## Miscellaneous Projects

This is the part of the page where unfinished projects live.
Delve in if you dare.

Eggsplosion is a stealth game where you play as a chicken with exploding eggs.
You may see why that's not an ideal combination.
