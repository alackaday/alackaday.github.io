We make games too!

Freshly baked, artisanal games. Straight out of the oven.

Inventure is an action puzzler in which you play an adventurer's Mum.
Organise your daughter's inventory and give her the items she needs to stay alive on her dangerous quest.

We've released a fully playable prototype of Inventure over on Itch.io, which you can download for free.
Give it a play, and let us know if you enjoy it.
If people like it, we'll try and make it into a full game, with a load more stuff in it!

It's All Gallows' Eve, and the skeletons have come out to play their favourite game! Save them from the noose by solving their word puzzles,  racking up a huge score multiplier and using wild perks in this puzzle roguelike.

Last Words is a roguelike word game based on the classic paper-and-pencil game of Hangman, but this time, you have to solve multiple puzzles at once. The more puzzles you can solve together, the higher your score multiplier.

## Too Large for the Barge

You're running a ferry for animals, but there's one problem.
The boat can only depart safely if it's perfectly balanced.
But you don't know how much each animal weighs.

Too Large for the Barge is a puzzle game where you need to try and work out how much different animals weigh so that you can keep the ferry balanced.
It's basically like the algebra you did back at school but cuddly and nautical.

## Miscellaneous Projects

This is the part of the page where unfinished projects live.
Delve in if you dare.

Eggsplosion is a stealth game where you play as a chicken with exploding eggs.
You may see why that's not an ideal combination.

Roguesnake is a roguelike version of Snake.
It's far from finished and there's no progression system.
But it's a fun mechanical demo.
